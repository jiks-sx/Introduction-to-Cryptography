# Hashing and Data Integrity

## What is Hashing?
Hashing converts data into a fixed-length value using a one-way function.

## Properties
- One-way
- Fixed output length
- Small input change produces large output change

## Secure Hash Algorithms
- SHA-256
- SHA-512

MD5 and SHA-1 are considered insecure.

### Why MD5 and SHA-1 Are Broken
- Collision attacks exist
- Attackers can forge data

Still used only for:
- Non-security checksums

### SHA-256
- Secure
- Widely used
- Industry standard
