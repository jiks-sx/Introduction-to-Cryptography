# Security Goals of Cryptography

## 1. Confidentiality

Ensures that data is accessible only to authorized users.

Achieved using:
- Encryption algorithms
- Secure key management

### Example:
- AES encrypting files
- HTTPS encrypting web traffic

Achieved using encryption algorithms such as AES.

## 2. Integrity

Ensures data has not been modified.

Achieved using:
- Hash functions
- Message Authentication Codes (MAC)
- Digital signatures

Example:
- File hash comparison
= Signed software updates

Achieved using hash functions and digital signatures.

## 3. Authentication

Verifies identity.

Achieved using:
- Digital certificates
- Public-key cryptography
- Passwords + cryptography

Example:
- HTTPS certificate validation

Achieved using certificates and public-key cryptography.

## 4. Non-Repudiation

Sender cannot deny an action.

Achieved using:
- Digital signatures
- Private key ownership

Example:
- Signed legal documents
- Software signing

Achieved using digital signatures.
