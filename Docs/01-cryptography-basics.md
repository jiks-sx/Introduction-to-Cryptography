# Cryptography Basics

## What is Cryptography?
Cryptography is the science of protecting information by transforming
it into a secure format so that only authorized parties can access it.
At its core, cryptography solves trust problems in an untrusted world.

## It answers questions like:
- Who sent this data?
- Has this data been changed?
- Can anyone else read this data?
- Can the sender deny sending this data?

### Without cryptography:
- Internet banking is impossible
- HTTPS cannot exist
- VPNs cannot secure traffic
- Software updates cannot be trusted

## Why Cryptography is Needed
Without cryptography:
- Data can be read by attackers
- Messages can be modified
- Identities can be forged
- Secure communication is impossible

Cryptography is essential for secure communication over untrusted networks
such as the internet.
