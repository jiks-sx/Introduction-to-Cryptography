# Introduction to Cryptography

This repository contains a deep theoretical and practical introduction
to cryptography.

explains cryptographic concepts from first principles and demonstrates hands-on experiments using OpenSSL.

## Objectives
- Understand cryptography fundamentals
- Learn symmetric and asymmetric encryption
- Encrypt files using AES
- Generate RSA key pairs
- Understand hashing and integrity
- Learn digital signatures
- Study real-world cryptography usage (HTTPS, VPN)

## Tools Used
- OpenSSL
- Kali Linux / Linux Terminal /VM
- CyberChef (alternative)

## Important Note
No insecure or illegal practices were performed.
All experiments follow ethical cybersecurity standards.

## Outcome
Strong foundational understanding of cryptography and its real-world applications.
